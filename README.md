🎬 Netflix Content Strategy & Clustering Analysis
Live demo: https://netflixcapstone.streamlit.app/
📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive unsupervised machine learning analysis of the Netflix catalog. By merging standard metadata with external IMDb ratings, this study moves beyond simple categorization to provide a quality-centric view of Netflix's evolution. The core goal is to understand the "thematic DNA" of content and automate the discovery of "Micro-genres" to enhance user recommendation systems.

🔍 The Problem Statement & Business Context
Since 2010, Netflix’s library has seen a dramatic shift. While the number of movies has stabilized, the volume of TV shows has tripled.
Objectives:

Analyze the Pivot: Investigate the shift toward episodic content and its impact on user engagement.

Identify Quality Hubs: Pinpoint geographical regions producing the highest-rated content.

Automate Discovery: Use NLP to cluster content into 6 strategic pillars to power hyper-personalized user "rows."

💡 Key Strategic Findings
1. The Quality-Volume Paradox
Finding: While the US leads in total production volume, countries like India and South Korea serve as "Quality Hubs," producing content that achieves significantly higher average IMDb scores.

Recommendation: Netflix should continue aggressive investment in localized "Originals" from these hubs, as they offer a superior ROI for prestige content globally.

2. TV Show Dominance
Finding: TV shows generally maintain higher critical engagement than movies on the platform. This validates the business shift toward episodic content, which drives long-term subscriber retention ("stickiness").

3. Thematic Content Pillars
Through K-Means Clustering, we successfully identified 6 core thematic segments:

International Romantic Dramas

Kids & Family Animation

Documentary & True-Crime

Action, Sci-Fi & Adventure

Stand-Up Comedy

Scripted Regional Content (focused on India/Asia)

🛠️ Technical Workflow
1. NLP Pipeline
Pre-processing: Regex cleaning, lowercasing, and Lemmatization to normalize text.

Vectorization: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) with 5,000 features and n-gram ranges (1, 2) to capture context.

2. Clustering Algorithms
We evaluated three models to ensure robust grouping:

K-Means (Final Model): Achieved the best separation with a Silhouette Score of 0.0162.

Hierarchical Clustering: Used Dendrogram analysis to visualize the "genealogy" of sub-genres.

DBSCAN: Used to identify "Outliers"—highly unique, non-formulaic titles that represent niche content categories.

## 🎯 Mission & data‑preparation (Jupyter notebook)

**Mission:** produce a clean, semantically‑rich dataset and lightweight ML artifacts that power a fast, explainable Streamlit demo. All heavy data‑work was performed in the Jupyter notebook so the app only needs to load precomputed artifacts for responsive UI and repeatable results.

What we did in the notebook (`netfilx_ml.ipynb`):
- Merge sources: raw Netflix export(s) + external metadata (IMDb / RottenTomatoes where available).
- Clean & normalize: fix missing values, normalize dates/years, deduplicate and standardize text fields.
- Text assembly & NLP prep: build a `text_blob` (title + genres + synopsis + cast), then apply regex cleaning, lowercasing, stop‑word removal and lemmatization.
- Feature engineering: train a TF‑IDF vectorizer (1–2 grams, feature cap) and transform the corpus.
- Model training & evaluation: train K‑Means (choose k via silhouette/inspection) and inspect cluster contents.
- Export: serialize artifacts used by the app (`netflix_tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`, `netflix_kmeans_model.pkl`) and save the cleaned dataset (`netflix_final_clustered_data.csv`).

Why we keep this in the notebook:
- Reproducible EDA, easy parameter tuning and visual inspection during preprocessing.
- Streamlit remains snappy because the app loads pickled artifacts rather than retraining or reprocessing on each run.

Example notebook export (used by `app.py`):
```py
pickle.dump(best_kmeans, open('netflix_kmeans_model.pkl','wb'))
pickle.dump(tfidf, open('netflix_tfidf_vectorizer.pkl','wb'))
df.to_csv('netflix_final_clustered_data.csv', index=False)
```

How the Streamlit app consumes these artifacts:
- loads the pickled TF‑IDF vectorizer + K‑Means model and the cleaned CSV at startup
- precomputes a TF‑IDF matrix for fast cosine similarity lookups
- cleans & vectorizes user input with the same TF‑IDF object, predicts cluster with the saved model, and returns cluster members filtered by cosine similarity (slider controls strictness)
🚀 How to Run the App
Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn nltk wordcloud
Launch the Streamlit app:

Bash
streamlit run app.py

How to use the live demo
- Open the live demo at: `https://netflixcapstone.streamlit.app/` or run locally with the command above.
- Paste a content description into the text area (examples below) and click **Predict & Recommend**.
- The app predicts a thematic cluster and shows 5 suggested titles from that cluster — each suggestion includes the poster image plus inline action links ("View on Netflix" / "IMDb") that open in a new tab.
- Use the **🔄 Suggest More** button to load additional unseen recommendations from the same cluster. When the cluster is exhausted the control becomes **🔁 Reset & Suggest Again**.

Quick input examples (paste into the description box)
- "Investigative true-crime documentary about organized crime and corruption"
- "Lighthearted family animation about friendship and adventurous animals"
- "Sci-fi action with space travel and time-manipulation themes"

Behaviour & matching
- Recommendations are filtered by semantic similarity to the description (TF‑IDF + cosine similarity). This prevents overly broad results — e.g. searching for a crime documentary will not return unrelated sports documentaries.
- If the model cannot find close matches inside the predicted cluster, the UI will show a warning and fall back to broader results.

Configuration & tuning
- Similarity threshold (controls result strictness): edit `SIM_THRESHOLD` inside `app.py` (default: `0.08`). Lower → broader results, Higher → stricter results.
- To show confidence scores or change the recommendation batch size, edit `pick_and_store()` in `app.py`.
